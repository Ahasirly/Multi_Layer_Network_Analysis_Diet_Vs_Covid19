# Multi-Layer Network Analysis: Diet vs COVID-19

This repository contains the COSC 421 project exploring how global dietary supply patterns relate to COVID-19 outcomes using network science techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `code/` – R scripts for network construction, clustering, and visualisation.
- `data/` – Food supply and health indicator CSVs from the Kaggle dataset.
- `Plots/` – Generated PDF figures (each script writes to its own file).
- `proposal.md` – Project proposal outlining research questions and timeline.

## Getting Started
1. Install R packages: `tidyverse`, `igraph`, `ggraph`, `scales`, `readr`.
2. Run scripts with `Rscript code/<n>.R`; figures will appear in `Plots/`.
3. Review `proposal.md` for research context and planned analyses.

Developed by Lucas Xu, Luke Yin, and Shuyu Yan for COSC 421.
